# Binance-API-Work
Experimental research around Binance API and FTX API (mainly Python)

Error ciso8601 compilation try (Windows) :

For the use of ftx api (pip install ftx), you will need the following file to install VC++ Build Tools (don't forget to select Windows 10 SDK in the Payload sub menu) :

vs_buildtools__1528869669.1639057343.exe

Error ciso8601 compilation try (Linux) :

When trying to install ftx (pip install ftx) on Linux you could also get an error (not on Ubuntu but eg. on Amazon Linux) ; I think that you might need to install the equivalent of VC++ build tools but for Linux.
