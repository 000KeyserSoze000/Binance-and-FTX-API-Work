FTX Data history in H1 for all assets available on FTX (spot, futures...) until today (2022-01-07 16h UTC) :
- You can download the 102 MB zipped file (.7z format) here https://cloud.degoo.com/share/4PUNIN26wUJirhAbUl9_Jg 
- You will have to use 7zip application to unzip the file (no password needed)
- When unzipped you will have 1.1 GB of files
- Unzip the file and there will be one file per asset eg. scan_ADA_PERP, scan_BTC_USD etc...
- You will need to parse each line (kind of JSON format per line)
- TODO : I might export another version of all these files for easy integration into MS Excel or any
- TODO : I might upload updated version of data (that will then be greater than 102 MB)
